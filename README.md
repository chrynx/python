This is the start of my python projects


Dice

This is the first project that I am going to build.
- At first, it's very simple, run the file and get a random number from 1 to 6, just like rolling a die.
- Added a raw input variable that allows the user to input their own number to have a guess what the roll will be. - Added an if statement that checks whether the user input matches the die roll. If it does, the user gets a prompting stating well done, otherwise, they get a prompt stating better luck next time.
- Added some error checks now (just in case some users try to be smart and not follow the simple instruction). If the user inputs something below 1, above 6, or a letter, they will get an error and will be continued to be asked for the right number.

Tambay ( A filipino word for the phrase hang out )

- Started by having a simple Q and A with the user. just asking where the user wants to hang out. The reseponse would be an answer saying, I wanna hang out at that place
- Did a for loop that allows users to input multiple times. Still need to add some error checks.

Tic_Tac_Toe

- Started by having a function that prints the 3 x 3 game board.
- Added prompts that would take both users names.
- I then scripted a few lines where it will take 2 numbers, the row and the column where the x or o will be positioned.
- Then I doubled that code to enable the switching between Xs and Os.
- Added win conditions that will check the board state whether there is already a winner after the player takes its turn.
- Added a turn count where after 9 turns, the board should be filled and it does a final win check, if there is no winner, a draw print will show and the program will end.

Area_Of_Circle

- A simple function to check the area of a circle. Takes a radius as an input and spits out the area of the circle in question.

BMI_Calculator

- Takes two inputs, height and weight.
- It then passes those inputs as arguments to find out the BMI of the person.
- After the BMI is calculated, it also shows in which bracket does your BMI belong to.

Loan_Calculator

- Takes in three inputs, the amount, how many months it should be repaid, and the interest rate at which the contraact is agreed upon.
- These inputs are then fed into the function which calculates the total monthly payment.
- The input prompts also includes confirmation prompts to ensure that the right amount is inputted.
