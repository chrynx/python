This is the start of my python projects


First project - Dice

This is the first project that I am going to build.
1 - At first, it's very simple, run the file and get a random number from 1 to 6, just like rolling a die.
2 - I have added a raw input variable that allows the user to input their own number to have a guess what the roll will be.
3 - Added an if statement that checks whether the user input matches the die roll. If it does, the user gets a prompting stating well done, otherwise, they get a prompt stating better luck next time.
4 - I have added some error checks now (just in case some users try to be smart and not follow the simple instruction). If the user inputs something below 1, above 6, or a letter, they will get an error and will be continued to be asked for the right number.

Second project - Tambay ( A filipino word for the phrase hang out )
1 - Started by having a simple Q and A with the user. just asking where the user wants to hang out. The reseponse would be an answer saying, I wanna hang out at that place
2 - did a for loop that allows users to input multiple times. Still need to add some error checks.
