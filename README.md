This is the start of my python projects


First project - Dice

This is the first project that I am going to build.
1 - At first, it's very simple, run the file and get a random number from 1 to 6, just like rolling a die.
2 - I have added a raw input variable that allows the user to input their own number to have a guess what the roll will be.
