This is going to be a python file that will help me learn GCSE Physics. I hope that it can help other people as well.

This file will contain different functions that students will need to answer correctly, just to jog their mind a bit.
Please be informed that this will be a straightforward build, not error handling and the such.

Thank you,
Chrynx
